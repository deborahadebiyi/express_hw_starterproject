# express_hw_starterproject

A starter project creating an express app from scratch to familiarise myself with the tools used by LEGO.

# Actions
1. Build an express app from scratch following the express docs and get 'Hello World' working
2. Once that's working, create a simple healthcheck endpoint (ie. /ping that would return a 200 statuscode and 'OK')
3. Use swagger to define your healthcheck endpoint
4. Unit test this endpoint using jest
